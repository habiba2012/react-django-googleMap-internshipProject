            <p>We are a Copenhagen-based group of sustainable fashion enthusiasts who decided to give back and actively join the sustainable fashion movement.
                We are the team that wears Conscious Sweater:</p>
            <br />
            <p >Veronika is our founder and CEO. She started thinking about a map of sustainable fashion shops back in 2015 when she lived in London. ‘I was so surprised that no one has made it yet
             that I thought this idea must be waiting for me to make it happen!’</p>

            <br />
            <p>Bára worked as well on Conscious Sweater map design & our branding. And she also created the initial Conscious Sweater copy. </p>
            <br />
            <p> Robin was our initial developer who built
                the very first pieces of the Conscious Sweater map!</p>
            <br />
            <p>Nila studied communication in Copenhagen. She is a passionate writer and Conscious Sweater’s voice on social media channels. </p>
            <br />
            <p>Habiba coded the version of
                 the map that you can see and explore it now. She studied Web development and enjoys coding as anything else. </p>
            <br />
            <p>Finn helps us structure the coding & advises us on the web development process.</p>
